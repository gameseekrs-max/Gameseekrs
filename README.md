On-chain Anchor program for **Vault Runner** — a **GameSeekrs** arcade title **for [Solana Mobile Seeker](https://solanamobile.com/seeker)** (Android). PDAs are per this program id.

**Handoff (2026-04-26):** Privacy + README copy updated for **Seeker**; **`main` pushed** to **`gameseekrs-max/Gameseekrs`**. **GSkrs Flashlight** client is **not** this repo; legal for Flashlight is `docs/PRIVACY_GSKRS_FLASHLIGHT.md` (Flashlight’s own git remote **not** created yet on the dev machine used for that pass).

- Reach Level 3 → FREE Legend SBT (first 1000 mints)
- SKR claim for Legend holders

**Open-source:** Only the Anchor smart contract (for full on-chain transparency).  
The **React Native** Vault Runner client is developed separately and is **not** required to be open-source.

**Vault Runner program (this repo, not legacy zip IDs):**
